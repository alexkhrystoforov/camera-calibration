## I experimented with different size of calibration dataset and here what I got

Full dataset - 64 photos. Randomly took 5,10..60 photos ( with step=5 ) from the dataset and calibrate the camera on the ‘new’ set. Then compare them with GT.
The ground truth intrinsic parameters - what we have from the full dataset (64 photos).

Error = GT - new parameter
